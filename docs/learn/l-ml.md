# Graphs for Machine Learning and AI

## Why Graph + ML
You might be thinking why Graphs for Macvhine Learning and AI? There are a few reasons including that it's a **natural data model**, we think in terms of graphs which means graphs can be modeled very logically and naturally.

Graphs also provide **richer data** by having connections between entities which allow us to create graph-based features. Graphs have always had a natural role in **machine learning** if you look at unsupervised learning through graph algorithms, frequent pattern mining and learning through neural networks, deep learning you will see the corrolations with graph. 

Graph data models are uniquely qualified to provide explanatory AI which through traditional ML techniques is hard to provide. Native graphs with **Massively Parallel Processing** - (like TigerGraph) enable large scale feature extraction and in-graph analytics which can be more challenging with many joins in a relational database.

**2.** [Feature Set Extraction for Machine Learning](#feature-set-extraction-for-machine-learning)

**3.** [ML Enrichment with Graph Features](#machine-learning-enrichment-with-graph-features)

**4.** [Graph Enrichment with Machine Learning](#graph-enrichment-with-machine-learning)

**5.** [In-database ML Techniques for Graphs](#in-database-machine-learning)

### Hands On Project
In this exercise, we will load a small graph with natural communities into the TigerGraph graph platform, install the Louvain Modularity algorithm from the graph algorithm library, run the algorithm, and visualize the result.

### Hands On Project 2

In this exercise, we take a synthetic dataset for retail purchase fraud, model it as a graph, extract various graph-based and non-graph-based features, export the feature vectors, and use conventional ML techniques to train a fraud prediction model.  The graph model enables the 

This exercise is taken directly from an exercise in Andrew Ng's Coursera online course on Machine Learning.
